      # Nodester Roadmap      
      We are currently a non versioned application and this needs to fixed. Therefore the following is a rough roadmap for the project.
      ### Pre Work
      There are various issues that require resolution. Some have been planned, others are still awaiting completion. I have treated the following as bugs, the rest I am not including here at this point as I feel they are features and require later timeslotting based upon necessity.
      #### Issues from GitHub Issue Tracker
      - [15][] Replace curl line from scripts/gitrepoclone.sh to be a JS script
      - [26][] NPM Modules list action support? ([143][] allows to be fixed.)
      - [32][] Use package.json for npm dependencies
      - [79][] Need a way to add more SSH Keys.
